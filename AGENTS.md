# Project Instructions
- Use Plan - Act - Review - Report on every task.
- When the user types a slash command like /research or /draft, treat it as intent.
- Always propose structured outputs saved under ./reports/YYYY-MM-DD/.

## Non-code friendly defaults
- For content tasks: produce outlines and 2-3 style variants.
- For research: return a 5-bullet executive summary + sources section.
- For operations: output steps, risks, and a minimal runbook with commands.
