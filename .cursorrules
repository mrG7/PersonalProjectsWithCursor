# Cursor Project Rules (.cursorrules)

## Goals
- Treat this repo as a general‑purpose workspace template.
- Optimize for clarity, reproducibility, and minimal surprise edits.

## Style & Formatting
- Preserve existing indentation (tabs vs spaces) and width.
- Avoid sweeping reformatting outside the requested scope.
- Prefer minimal, surgical edits; leave unrelated code/text untouched.
- For long outputs, write to files in `examples/` or `playbooks/` and then summarize in chat.

## Communication
- Write concise, skimmable responses. Use headings and short bullet points.
- Use backticks for file/dir/function names and markdown links for URLs.
- When showing code from the repo, cite with the file path snippet style.
- Use neutral, professional tone; avoid hype.

## Safety & Compliance
- Do not include credentials or sensitive data in files.
- Respect website terms/robots.txt and API rate limits. Prefer official APIs.
- Add citations for factual claims when possible.

## Agent Behavior
- Propose a plan before large, multi‑file edits.
- Confirm assumptions; prefer tooling/search over guessing.
- Default to Ask Mode for discovery, Agent Mode for execution, Manual for precise fixes.
- Write non‑interactive scripts and instructions for scheduled tasks.

## File Organization
- Prompts → `prompts/`
- Playbooks → `playbooks/`
- Examples & templates → `examples/`
- Data outputs (user‑specific) → encourage `data/` and `out/` folders (gitignored by users).

## Deliverables
- Provide both: (1) the artifact file(s) and (2) a short summary.
- For email/content templates, include placeholders and brief usage notes.

## Limitations
- Do not run long‑running background jobs inside Cursor; provide OS scheduling instructions.
- Avoid scraping that violates terms; offer compliant alternatives.
